# Adaptive Placement Preparation System (PoC)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a real-time adaptive learning platform designed for college placement preparation. It uses a **Skill Drift Detection** algorithm to continuously analyze student performance. If a student struggles or takes too long to answer, the system detects "drift," lowers the difficulty, and provides personalized, context-aware explanations (simulated RAG pipeline).

## 🚀 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios
* **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
* **Database:** (Mocked) In-memory Python lists for PoC
* **AI/ML:** Scikit-learn logic for drift detection, simulated RAG responses
